# Zentry Clone

This project is a clone of the Zentry application, created following a tutorial by JavaScript Mastery. The original tutorial used JavaScript, but I implemented the project using TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability. The goal was to learn modern web application development and work with key technologies.

### ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Vite â€“ Fast development environment

React.js â€“ Component-based UI approach

TypeScript â€“ Strongly typed JavaScript

GSAP â€“ Animation library for smooth UI interactions

React Icons â€“ Icon library for UI elements

Tailwind CSS â€“ Utility-first styling framework

### ðŸš€ Running the Project

```
git clone https://github.com/florixak/zentry-clone.git
cd zentry-clone
npm install
npm run dev
```
### âœ¨ What I Learned

The biggest problem for me was GSAP, I have never worked with that to now. I have to say it is a really powerful tool for animations and I will 100% use it in the future.

### ðŸ“Œ Note

This project is based on a tutorial and is not intended for production use. If I decide to continue working on it, I would consider implementing custom modifications and improvements.
